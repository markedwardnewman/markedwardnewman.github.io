Platform-independent, **responsive**, **easily-modified**, fully functional **sites** and **single-page applications** delivered to virtual front doors across the globe daily. Would-be ribbon winning advocate for **[W3C's semantic markup standards](https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=http%3A%2F%2Fmarkedwardnewman.com%2F&showoutline=yes)**, **Google’s Material Design guidelines**, and *using only those frameworks that are suitable for the task at hand*. Professional contact with **backbone.js**, tinkering affairs with AngularJS and React, engaged to **Angular2**. **HTML5**, **CSS3** and **JavaScript** are hand-coded when practical and scaffolded when not. Avoids the chaos by playing with **Npm task-runners** and **build tools** while on break.

Have a published **[Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thelazyboyfriend.app&hl=en)** distributed via **Google Play** that uses their **Adwords API**. It generates enough revenue to fetch me one of those coffees with the sassy swirls every Friday morning!

Have developed a couple of from-the-ground-up **Ruby on Rails** sites with a back-end that shields against nefarious internet shenanigans. I **[tutored myself](https://github.com/markedwardnewman/sample_app)** on the first one by including **SSL encryption**, email-based **account activation** and password reset, secure **authorization encryption** (using bcrypt), session-based cookies, and regexually constrained **form validation**. Also prototyped a platform-based Ruby on Rails site that taps the shared economy for revenue generation (think Airbnb). This is **[Italianway](https://en.italianway.house/)** in action!

Enough **Drupal** experience to be dangerous. Set-up and deployment, user account administration, theme and template creation, server-side code integration, and all things front-end. Recent proponent of Kirby, a file-based CMS.
