##Background
Historically, the first computer I had was a Commodore VIC-20 and, although I do reminisce about programming in BASIC, I still remain just as enchanted with computers and their capabilities as I did the first time I typed &quot;GLOBAL THERMONUCLEAR WAR&quot; into my TV screen. Luckily we are all still here although my ten year old self was a little disappointed when the only thing that happened was that the little flashing square just kept on flashing. Fortunately time has replaced those childish expectations and replaced them with the type of emotional satisfaction that can only be won by using a direct, calm and logical manner.

Since then, computers!
